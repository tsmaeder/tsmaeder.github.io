Unless you are living under the computer equivalent of a rock, you will have heard of some controversial moves in the field of software licensing recently. First, Facebook (Meta) licensed their LLama language model under a license that contained a non-compete clause: in short: if you made a very successful product base on the model, you would no longer have a license. Then Red Hat, a pillar of the Open Source scene, announced that if you took Red Hat Enterprise Linux and published some of the sources of that product, they would no longer license any future versions of RHEL to you. Lastly, Hashicorp, maker of Vagrant and Terraform among others, changed their license to BSL, basically preventing you from competing with them if you used their stuff. This is not a new phenomenon, there have been other companies moving to "less than strictly Open Source" licences with Couchbase, MariaDB, MongoDB and Confluent among the most prominent. But what's new is that when companies like MongoDB did this in the past, the move was almost universally decried, where as now some folks tell us to get with the program, because "grow up!", this is the new normal.
